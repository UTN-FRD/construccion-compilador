The two main reference points are
- [norvigs toy lisp impl](http://norvig.com/lispy.html): from which we got the basics
- [Racket lisp](https://docs.racket-lang.org/getting-started/index.html): the lisp implementation that we aim to (right now we are not very close but the ideal is to make something like Ractket syntax wise)
