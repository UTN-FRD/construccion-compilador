# frd-lisp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/github/UTN-FRD/construccion-compilador.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/UTN-FRD/construccion-compilador)

Lisp written in Rust as part of a research project in UTN-FRD (Universidad Tecnologica Nacional - Facultad Regional Delta)


## Running the code

Install
- [Rust (latest stable), via Rustup is recommended](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [rust fmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt)
- [rust clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)
- git


Clone
- `git clone {repo_url}`

Run

- `cargo run`
or
- `cargo test`

## Code quality

- PRs MUST have passing builds to be merged
- be sure to auto format your code with `cargo fmt`
- add tests for new features
- be sure to use `cargo clippy` to detect common problems in your code (we cannot include this in the CI process because of an outstanding issue between clippy and lalrpop https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop/pull/384)

The two main reference points are
- [norvigs toy lisp impl](http://norvig.com/lispy.html): from which we got the basics
- [Racket lisp](https://docs.racket-lang.org/getting-started/index.html): the lisp implementation that we aim to (right now we are not very close but the ideal is to make something like Ractket syntax wise)
- [Racket lisp](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41417892/what-is-the-difference-between-and-brackets-in-racket-lisp-programming) `()` vs `[]`
